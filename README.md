### Data Visualization Final Project: Population Growth Trends

#### Binder

This project can be viewed using Binder.
The package 'Voila' will render the Jupyter Notebook so that the markdown is visible, code is hidden and the graphics are interactive.
This is how I intended my report to be read.

Please use this Binder Launch Link: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sean-coffey/visualization/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fdata_visualization_final_project.ipynb)

#### GitHub

The binder link does work, but it sometimes takes quite a time to build the Docker image and then launch the Notebook.
In case the link is not working for you, here is a link to the GitHub public repository, with the files for the project:
1) data_visualization_final_project.ipynb  - the Jupyter Notebook containing my final report
2) requirements.txt - the package requirements to run the Notebook successfully
3) /data/WPP2024_TotalPopulationBySex%202.csv - the csv file downloaded from UN Population Statistics Site.

### Description

I decided to use the UN population data for my visualization project. 
Mainly because I was surprised to discover that far from having a population growth crisis, for many countries population is already peaking. 
For the world as a whole, various scenarios suggest the tipping point will likely be in the next 30 - 60 years. 
My over-arching goal for the visualization is to provide a tool that will let users quickly explore the population changes and understand where they are happening and which ones are significant. There are visualizations available on the web, the ones I looked at focused on precise selection of region of interest and gave clear line charts showing trends (and in some cases potential projection confidence intervals). I did not find a tool that allowed a rapid comparison between regions, so this became my focus.

As with all the projects I have done so far on the MS-DS course, my primary objective is learning. As such, I am less concerned with the niceties of the data-set and the functionality of the visuals, than: did I learn more about the method? did I try to apply the tools and frameworks? have I improved my ability to code such visualizations?
